# 🕺 Hi! I'm Thomas.

🚀 **Computer Science Student at Western University, interested in cybersecurity and cloud engineering**.

### 🔭 What I'm doing
- My main project right now is building the [***Data Dashboard***](https://github.com/LlamzonAmazon/PC-Data-Dash) for [**PlanCatalyst**](https://www.plancatalyst.org) which forecasts country development with regression modelling on human rights growth (UN SDGs), climate change resilience (ND-GAIN), and financial capacity (World Bank data).
  - I'm building my skills with **ML tools/frameworks** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** with this project.
  - The dashboard improves PlanCatalyst's stakeholders' trust and perception of their data-driven decision-making capabilities, helping the organization grow their international impact.
- I'm in in the **cybersecurity** field as an analyst, and I'm looking to bridge this experience with my skills in **software development** and passion for **cloud systems**.
- I am also completing my thesis, titled: *Asynchronous Shallow-Deep Layer Split Updates for More Efficient Federated Learning Networks in IoT Health Devices*
  - I am also building my skills with ML tools/frameworks with this project.
- I am also **Vice President of Projects at Western AI** where I oversee four distinct ML project teams each respectively led by a Project Manager. The projects include:
  - ***[Shotgun Guardian](https://github.com/Western-Artificial-Intelligence/realtime-drowsiness-detector)*** – Driver Drowsiness Detector with `OpenCV`,`YOLOv8n`, and `PyTorch`
  - ***[ClipFarm](https://github.com/Western-Artificial-Intelligence/video-virality-predictor)*** – Short-form Video Virality Analyzer with `CLIP`, `OpenL3`, and `PyTorch`
  - ***[Affordcast](https://github.com/Western-Artificial-Intelligence/condo-cost-predictor)*** – Toronto Condo-Affordability Forecaster with `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, and `scikit-learn`
  - ***[CodeBuster](https://github.com/Western-Artificial-Intelligence/codesim-detector)*** – Code-similarity Detector with `CodeBERT` and `scikit-learn`

Needless to say, I have a fair amount of work on my hands right now.
