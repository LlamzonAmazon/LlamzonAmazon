# 👋 Hi! I'm Thomas.

🚀 **Computer Science Student at Western University, interested in cybersecurity and cloud engineering**.

### 🔭 What I'm doing
- I'm currently building a **Data Dashboard** as a **Project Manager at TSI** for [PlanCatalyst](https://www.plancatalyst.org) that integrates UN, World Bank, and ND-GAIN data to produce actionable sustainability insights.
  - I'm **building by skills with ML tools** (`scikit-learn`) and **cloud platforms** (`AWS`) with this project.
  - This project is very meaningful to the PlanCatalyst organization as it improves their stakeholders' perception and trust in PlanCatalyst's data-driven decision-making capabilities, helping the organization expand their international impact.
- I'm in in the **cybersecurity** field as an analyst, and I'm looking to bridge this experience with my skills in **software development** and passion for **cloud systems**.
- I am also the **Vice President of Projects at Western AI**, and I oversee four distinct ML-focused project teams each led by a resepective Project Manager. The projects include:
  - ***Shotgun Guardian*** – Driver Drowsiness Detector with `OpenCV`
  - ***ClipFarm*** – Short-form Video Virality Analyzer with `CLIP` and `OpenL3`
  - ***Affordcast*** – Toronto Condominium Affordability Forecaster with `scikit-learn`
  - ***CodeBuster*** – Code-similarity Detector with `CodeBERT`
