# 👋 Hi! I'm Thomas.

🚀 **Interested in cybersecurity and cloud engineering.**

### 🔭 What I'm doing
- I'm currently building a **Data Dashboard** for [PlanCatalyst](https://www.plancatalyst.org) integrating UN, World Bank, and ND-GAIN data to produce actionable sustainability insights.
  - I'm building by skills with ML tools (`scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`) and cloud platforms (`AWS`) with this project.
  - This project is both very educational for me and impactful to the PlanCatalyst organization, helping them help others.
- I'm in in the **cybersecurity** field as an analyst, and I'm looking to bridge my experience with my skills in software development.
